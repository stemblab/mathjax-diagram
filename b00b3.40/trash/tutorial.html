MathJax can be configured to generate SVG, 
yet it is difficult to integrate this SVG into an SVG diagram.
One approach uses SVG's <code>foreignObject</code>, but this isn't
compatible with all browsers (e.g., IE and sometimes Firefox).
Moreover, standalone SVG files don't support <code>foreignObject</code>.
(Note, however, that this can sometimes be solved by wrapping the SVG
in html tags.)

But there is a solution.  First, here's a div with some MathJax.
We'll use just a single character to make the SVG code easy to follow.
But this method works for more complex MathJax expressions.
